# YOUR PERSONALIZED LOOM SCRIPT FOR POPPY AI
## *Technical + Enthusiastic Approach*
### Total Time: ~3 minutes

---

## **SECTION 1: Opening (20 seconds)**

"Hey [Interviewer Name]! I'm Raj, and I have to say - when I explored Poppy AI, I actually got pretty excited. The visual canvas approach to AI workflows? That's such a clever solution to a real problem I've experienced myself while building AI-powered applications. Let me tell you why I think I'd be a great fit for your team and hopefully give you a sense of who I am beyond the resume."

## **SECTION 2: Show You're "Hungry" - AI/ML Experience (90 seconds)**

"So here's the thing - I'm someone who genuinely gets excited about building products that make complex AI technology feel intuitive. Looking at Poppy AI, what really resonates with me is how you've taken multiple AI models - ChatGPT, Claude - and made them work together in this interconnected visual workspace. That's not trivial engineering, and it's exactly the kind of challenge I love.

I've actually built multiple AI applications recently. There's my **PDF Q&A AI SaaS platform** that uses Claude AI with RAG architecture for document analysis. And I just deployed an **advanced AI chatbot platform** powered by GPT-4o with real-time web search, file handling, and reasoning display - basically giving users transparent access to how the AI thinks. Both projects taught me a lot about integrating LLMs into production, managing conversation context, optimizing AI responses, and making complex AI capabilities feel seamless for users - a lot of what Poppy does at scale.

Beyond that, I've spent the last 5+ years building high-performance full-stack applications. My most recent portfolio site is built with **Next.js 16, React 19, and TypeScript** - using server components, App Router, and performance optimizations like RAF throttling and hardware-accelerated transforms. I'm obsessed with making things both technically solid *and* delightful to use.

What makes me 'hungry' for this role specifically? I'm at a point where I want to work on something that real users depend on daily. I saw reviews from content creators saying they save hundreds of hours with Poppy - **that** kind of impact is what motivates me to write better code and ship faster. Plus, the technical stack you're using - visual canvas architecture with ProseMirror, integrating multiple LLM providers, handling rich media analysis - these are exactly the challenges I want to tackle next."

**[Delivery note: Show genuine enthusiasm when talking about AI. Maybe gesture with hands when describing the canvas approach]**

## **SECTION 3: Personality + Culture Fit + Product Thinking (60 seconds)**

"A bit about how I work - I'm the person who actually enjoys debugging complex issues late at night because I want to understand *why* something broke. When I was optimizing my interactive background component, I didn't just fix the performance issue - I dug into canvas rendering, particle systems, and RAF optimization because I was genuinely curious.

I also really value shipping fast and iterating. I've worked on products used by millions - like the **Astra WordPress theme with 7 million+ active installations** - so I understand the importance of balancing velocity with quality. I noticed Poppy has evolved quite a bit based on user feedback, and that's exactly the kind of environment where I thrive.

I'm not precious about my code. If something needs to be refactored for better UX or performance, I'm the first to roll up my sleeves. I care deeply about the end user experience. When I build features, I'm always thinking: 'Will this actually make someone's life easier?'

And honestly, working on a product that combines AI, visual interfaces, and helps creative people work better? That hits all my interests. I'm a builder who cares about craft, but I also care deeply about whether users actually love what we build."

**[Delivery note: Be conversational here, maybe smile when mentioning the late-night debugging]**

## **SECTION 4: Technical Connection - Full-Stack Skills (45 seconds)**

"From a technical perspective, I bring strong experience in **React 19, Next.js 16, TypeScript**, and modern full-stack development. I've built AI integrations, complex state management systems, and responsive interfaces with libraries like Framer Motion and Tailwind CSS.

I saw Poppy uses **Chakra UI and ProseMirror** for the rich text editing - I haven't worked extensively with ProseMirror yet, but I love complex UI challenges and would dive in immediately. That's kind of my approach: figure it out, ship it, make it better.

I've also worked on performance-critical applications - optimizing canvas rendering, implementing hardware-accelerated animations, managing large-scale codebases. I understand the importance of writing scalable, maintainable code when you're building something users rely on every day."

**[Delivery note: Confident but not arrogant. You're stating facts about your experience]**

---

## **SECTION 5: Strong Close (15 seconds)**

"Bottom line - I'm genuinely excited about what you're building at Poppy. I bring the technical skills in AI integration and full-stack development, the product thinking to build things users love, and the hunger to contribute from day one. I think we'd work really well together, and I can't wait to chat more about how I can help make Poppy even better!"

**[Delivery note: End with energy and a smile. Look directly at camera]**

## **OPTIONAL: Visual Enhancement**

If you want to make it even more engaging, consider briefly screen-sharing during Section 2 or 4:

**Option A: Show your portfolio site (15 seconds)**
- "Let me quickly show you my portfolio - this interactive background you see? I built it with canvas optimization and particle physics. This is the kind of attention to detail I bring to everything I build."

**Option B: Show your AI Chatbot platform (15 seconds)**
- "Here's my AI chatbot platform I just deployed - it integrates GPT-4o with real-time web search and file handling. You can see the reasoning display feature here - users can actually see how the AI is thinking. This kind of transparent AI interaction is something I'm really passionate about."

**Option C: Show your PDF Q&A AI project (15 seconds)**
- "And here's that PDF Q&A AI SaaS I mentioned - it uses Claude AI with RAG architecture. You can see how I've integrated the AI, managed the conversation flow, and made it intuitive for users."
